Welcome to documentation of snpFC
=================================

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

snpFC - a python tool for filtering and comparing SNPs from two or multiple VCF files

Pre-requisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Assuming you have python3 already, install pyVCF ::
        
        pip install pyvcf

Quick Start
^^^^^^^^^^^

If you don't have patience, here is how to run snpFC ::
        
        python scripts/filter_and_comparesnps.py --vcf testfiles/test1.vcf testfiles/test2.vcf --filter --compare --show

The above command will output as following ::

        Common and Unique SNPS in vcf File :  testfiles/test1.vcf
        tig00000003 775 A G common
        tig00000003 776 T C common
        tig00000003 836 G C unique
        tig00000004 1166 G A common
        tig00000004 1190 G A unique
        Common and Unique SNPS in vcf File :  testfiles/test2.vcf
        tig00000003 775 A G common
        tig00000003 776 T C common
        tig00000003 836 G T unique
        tig00000004 1166 G A common
        tig00000004 1190 G A,C unique
        The outputs are saved in these files : /home/shrestha/Sites/test1_snpanalysis.txt /home/shrestha/Sites/test2_snpanalysis.txt



Options
^^^^^^^ 

Available options::

        --vcf                   space separated two or more vcf files
        --filter                filter snps
        --compare               compare snps between vcf files
        --frequency             frequency threshold value to filter
        --pvalue                pvalue threshold value to filter
        --genotype              genotype to filter
        --quality               genotype quality threshold to filter
        --rawreaddepth          raw read depth threshold to filter
        --qualityreaddepth      quality read depth threshold to filter
        --depthreference        depth in reference threshold to filter
        --depthvariant          depth in variant threshold to filter
        --show                  show the compared snps on screen
        --outdir                output directory

To check the options::
        
        python scripts/filter_and_comparesnps.py --help
